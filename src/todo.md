# This is where the list of things to do will go


- Need to make it so blue will always go first
- Need to give blue 1 extra card
- Saw that in codenames, that there are only 25 words on the board so do that 
- Need to create the rules and game loop
- figure out how to embed the words and create a model to predict a similar word without breaking the rules as the spymaster
- turn into a discord bot or a website. Maybe use flask or something
